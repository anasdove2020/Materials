# Design Pattern Cheat Sheet

### Factory

provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

| << Interface >> Product Product |
|---|
|+ create[]: void|











### Builder 

Constructs a complex object step by step, allowing for greater control over the construction process and enabling different representations of the object.








### Singleton 

Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance







### Command

Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clints with queues, request, and operation, as well as support for undoable operations.









### Abstract Factory 

Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.  










### Prototype

creates new object, known as the prototytpe, rather than creating instances from scratch .










### Chain of Responsibility

Passes a reques along a chain of handlers, where each handler decides either to process the request or pass it the next handler in the chain.









### Iterator 

Provides a way to access the element of a collection sequentially without exposing the underlying representation.
