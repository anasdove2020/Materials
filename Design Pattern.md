# Design Pattern Cheat Sheet

### Factory

provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.










### Builder 

Constructs a complex object step by step, allowing for greater control over the construction process and enabling different representations of the object.








### Singleton 

Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance







### Command

Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clints with queues, request, and operation, as well as support for undoable operations.









### Abstract Factory 

Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.  










### Prototype

creates new object, known as the prototytpe, rather than creating instances from scratch .










### Chain of Responsibility
