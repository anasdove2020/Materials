# Software Architectural Pattern

This means:
- ***Basic design idea*** used to organize and structure a software system.
- It helps decide how parts of the system talk each other.
- It is like blueprint for building software.

1. Event Driven Architecture
2. Layered Architecture
3. Monolithic Architecture
4. Microservice Architecture
5. Model View Controller (MVC)
6. Master Slave Architecture

## Event Driven Architecture

- Decoupled Components
- Asyncronous Communication

Good for Application:
- Event trigger action application
- Promoting scalability and responsiveness

## Layered Architecture

- Hierarchical structure with distinct layers (presentation, business logic, data)

Good for Application:
- Enterprise
- Improving maintainability & modular development

## Monolythic Architecture

- Unified codebase and deployment unit

Good for Application:
- Small application
- Simplicity focused instances

## Microservice Architecture

- Distributed system with independent and interoperable services

Good for Application:
- Large and complex system
- Enhancing scalability
- Fault isolation
- Development of independence service

## Model View Controller

- Separation of concerns into model, view, and controller components

Good for Application:
- Web Application
- Improving code organization and Maintenance
  - Separating complex logic from User Interface

## Master Slave Architecture

- Centralized control (master) with multiple worker nodes (slaves)

Good for Application:
- Ubiquitous in distributed computing
- Optimizing paraller processing and load balance
