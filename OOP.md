# OOP

- A way to build a program using Objects.
- Each object represent a real-world thing.
- Example objects: Hotel, Guest, Room

Hotel System using OOP

Using OOP
1. We create a class (template)
2. We create object (real items) from defined class
3. We organize our code like real-world things in a hotel

It means with OOP, our code becomes easier to manage, reusable and closer to real life. OOP makes code easier to organise because it groups related group together, like putting everything about a Room in one place. Reusable because the class can be used in another sytem.

Room Class
Data: Room Number, Room Type, and IsAvailable
Function: BookRoom() and CleanRoom()

Guest Class
Data: Guest Name, Email, Phone Number
Function: CheckIn(), CheckOut()

Hotel Class
Data: Hotel Name, Address, List of Room
Function: GetAvailableRooms(), AddGuest()
