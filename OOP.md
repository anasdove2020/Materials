# OOP

- A way to build a program using Objects.
- Each object represent a real-world thing.
- Example objects: Hotel, Guest, Room

Hotel System using OOP

Using OOP
1. We create a class (template)
2. We create object (real items) from defined class
3. We organize our code like real-world things in a hotel

It means with OOP, our code becomes easier to manage, reusable and closer to real life.

Room Class
Data: Room Number, Room Type, and IsAvailable
Function: BookRoom() and CleanRoom()

Guest Class
Data: Guest Name, Email, Phone Number
Function: CheckIn(), CheckOut()

Hotel Class
Data: Hotel Name, Address, List of Room
Function: GetAvailableRooms(), AddGuest()
