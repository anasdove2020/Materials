# Self Introduction

Hello, my name is **Choirul Anas**, and I graduated from **Ma Chung University** in **2011**, majoring in **Information Systems.**


I bring over **13 years of experience** in software engineering, with a strong focus on **designing, developing, architecting, and maintaining server-side technologies** using the .**NET ecosystem**. My core backend expertise includes **c#**, implementing **repository patterns with Entity Framework**, designing robust **service layers**, and building **RESTful APIs** using both .**NET Core** and .**NET Framework.**


On the frontend, I have solid experience developing **Single Page Applications (SPA)** using **ReactJS** and **AngularJS,** integrating them seamlessly with backend services to create responsive and dynamic user experiences.


Throughout my career, I've consistently worked in **cross-functional teams,** collaborating closely with **product managers, project managers,** and **stakeholders** to define, design, and deliver new features. I've participated in **agile development processes,** including **sprint planning,** **daily stand-ups,** and **retrospectives.**

Key areas of focus in my work include:
- **Optimizing application performance** - both on the server side (API) and the frontend - for **scalability, speed, and reliability.**
- **Troubleshooting and debugging** complex issues to improve system performance and stability.
- Ensuring **security best practices and data protection standards** are consistently met.
- Writing **clean, maintainable, and efficient code,** applying **SOLID principles** and industry best practices.

Some of the projects I've worked on include **hotel service platforms, financial systems**, and **enterprise applications** across various regions including **East Asia, Australia, and the Middle East.**


I'm passionate about building scalable and maintainable systems that directly support business goals, and I'm excited to bring that mindset into my next opportunity.
