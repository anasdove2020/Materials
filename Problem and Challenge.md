It could be architectural, a persnickety bug, scaling issues, or anything else. What was challenging? What was your role? What tradeoffs were part of the solution? What did you learn?

I have to handled existing project that the key person is suddenly resigned. My manager asked me to handle the bug and enhancement with limited time. What I did at that time is first I need to get the person number who handle the project to get global requirement, and create guess estimate about the enhancement and bug. With provided limited time I ask additional resource to complete the task.

Challenging Technical Problem: Taking Over an Abandoned Project Under a Tight Deadline

One of the most challenging situations I faced was when I was suddenly assigned to take over an existing project after the key developer unexpectedly resigned. The project had active bugs and pending enhancements, and my manager asked me to resolve them quickly due to a tight timeline and upcoming delivery.

My Role and Approach:
As the newly responsible person, I had very limited knowledge of the system. My first step was to identify who previously worked on the project and gather as much context as possible about the global requirements. Since documentation was minimal, I relied on commit history, old messages, and discussions with other team members to understand the business logic.

Next, I quickly analyzed the reported issues and proposed enhancements, creating rough effort estimates for each. Realizing the workload exceeded the available time, I communicated this clearly to my manager and requested an additional developer to assist me. I then divided the tasks based on complexity and familiarity, so we could work in parallel and maximize progress.

Trade-offs:
Given the time constraint, we had to prioritize critical fixes and high-impact enhancements over smaller UI issues and minor refactors. This meant accepting some technical debt in the short term to meet the deadline. We documented these for future cleanup.

What I Learned:

Adaptability: Jumping into unfamiliar code quickly and effectively is a valuable skill.

Communication: Clear communication with stakeholders helped manage expectations and secure additional resources.

Teamwork under pressure: Dividing tasks strategically and collaborating closely allowed us to deliver the key features on time.

This experience taught me the importance of balancing delivery speed with code quality, and how to stay calm and structured even in uncertain situations.
